# Healthcare Price Transparency Crowdsourcing Tool

## The Problem

Healthcare is neither transparent nor affordable. Whether you have no insurance, high deductible insurance, or a copay, the total cost of services matters. Most patients, especially the least insured patients, feel more vulnerable than safe in the hands of the medical system because they don't find out the cost of services until after they have received them. They are at the mercy of the billing system. What they need is a way of knowing in advance that they can receive quality care from an accessible doctor for a cost that won't compromise other determinants of health.

## The Vision

A world where patients can enjoy a healthy life free from the anxiety of medical costs.

## Our Solution: HEALTHI

We built a map-oriented web app, called HEALTHI, to help patients find affordable, quality care near them. The patient sees a map populated with markers colored by that provider's quality of care as measured by the [MIPS score](https://mdinteractive.com/MIPS), a federally designed means of measuring a provider's performance. Green markers indicate higher quality of care, red markers indicate lower quality of care, and orange and yellow are in the middle. The patient can hover over the markers to see the provider details. If they want to instead color the markers by affordability, they can do so with a simple click on the tool bar. Finally, if the patient has a particular specialty or procedure in mind, they can filter the markers down accordingly. This search can be find-tuned for specific levels of quality or affordability, as well.

## How It Works Now

  - CMS data to track affordability and quality of care
  - These provide comparative benchmarks
  - Problem: These don't make us money, nor do they distinguish us in the market

## How it Will Work

  - Users will be able to upload recent billing information to keep pricing data current.
  - Monetization is primarily through advertising at first and, once our database is large enough, through selling data.
  - One draw for customers and providers could be a service facilitating short-notice consultations with doctors who are willing to do those for free for underinsured patients.
